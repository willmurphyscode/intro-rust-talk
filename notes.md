According to some training I once took, you can only get three points in
a talk. The three things are:

1. Rust is a fundamental innovation in how we make programming languages, and why
2. Rust has a wonderful community, and you should get involved.
3. You should learn rust

## Points on 1

- Memory safety at compile time
- Trait-based generics (if I have time)
- Awesome macros

## Points on 2

- No one has ever yelled at me on `/r/rust`
- We're even nice to people who thought we were `/r/playrust`
- Lots of supportive community initiatives
    - e.g., using "edition" instead of "epoch" because it's easier for speakers of other languages
    - TODO: find more concrete examples

## Points on 3

- Web Assembly is going to break the tyranny of JavaScript, and then we'll be able to use other languages
- Rust is safe and secure by design - if I were building critical infrastructure code today, rust would be my first choice
